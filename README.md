# Best Day Senior Assessment

A digital movement and independence evaluation tool built for personal trainers and physical therapists at **Best Day Fitness** (St. Petersburg, FL). Replaces paper-based senior scorecards with a tablet-friendly app featuring built-in timers, auto-scoring, and client progress tracking.

Based on the **AFIT (Advanced Functional Independence Testing)** protocol from occupational therapy, adapted for the fitness and wellness setting.
